I audited Data and Visual Analytics, a Computer Science course at Georgia Tech.  This repository includes 
*Python and D3 code from the group project that Spring 2014.
*Screenshots of the D3 visualization
*PDF of the slides from the project presentation which includes screenshots of the d3 visualization.

The D3 demo can be run by downloading draviz.html, and the d3 folder (which contains d3.min.js and color), then clicking on draviz2.html or opening it with your web browzer.  directory structure is as follows:
