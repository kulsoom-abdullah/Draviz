I audited a course at Georgia Tech called Data and Visual Analytics.  This includes code from the group project that Spring 2014.
My contributions were the age_country.py feature, and the d3 visualization.
Please see the PDF of the slides from the project presentation.  IT also includes screenshots of the d3 visualization.

The D3 demo can be run by downloading draviz2.html, colorbrewer.v1.min.js and the d3 folder (which contains d3.min.js), then clicking on draviz2.html or opening it with your web browzer.  directory structure is as follows:

draviz2.html

colorbrewer.v1.min.js

d3/d3.min.js
