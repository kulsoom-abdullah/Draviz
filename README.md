I audited Data and Visual Analytics, a Computer Science course at Georgia Tech.  This repository includes 
* Python and D3 code from the group project that Spring 2014.
* Screenshots of the D3 visualization
* PDF of the slides from the project presentation which includes screenshots of the d3 visualization.

The D3 demo can be run by downloading *draviz.html*, and the d3 folder (which contains *d3.min.js* and *colorbrewer.v1.min.js*), then clicking on draviz2.html or opening it with your web browzer.
