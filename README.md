Draviz
======
I audited a course at Georgia Tech called Data and Visual Analytics.  This includes code from the group project that Spring 2014.
My contributions were the age_country.py feature, and the d3 visualization (in the d3 folder).
Please see the PDF of the slides from the project presentation.  IT also includes screenshots of the d3 visualization.
